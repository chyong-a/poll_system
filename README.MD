# Poll system
This project was created for a Web-programming assignment.
PHP was used to implement it.

## About the project
Created polls are displayed on the main page. Expired polls are displayed separately.
Only the properly filled out form can be submitted.
There is a registration system, hence a login system as well. Validation of users is implemented.
Data about users and polls are stored in json files.
An admin can create, modify, delete existing polls. Users can revote until the deadline of the poll.
The admin can create groups of existing users and assign polls to these groups (only members of the group can see the poll).
